#####Briefly About Myself:
My career is just beginning. After graduation, I realized that I wanted to develop in the field of IT and entered the College of Business and Law at the Department of Information Technology Software, additionally studying Java for Android application development and studying foreign languages.

At the moment I'm interested in mobile development, but I'm also interested in creating websites, but so far the results leave much to be desired and in order to get better at this, I enrolled in this course in the hope that they would help me learn the subject of website development.
